# Consider your failings too

“Whenever you take offense at someone’s wrongdoing,
immediately turn to your own similar failings, such as seeing
money as good, or pleasure, or a little fame—whatever form it
takes. By thinking on this, you’ll quickly forget your anger,
considering also what compels them—for what else could they
do? Or, if you are able, remove their compulsion.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 10.30

***Perspective: This is why it is so important not to write people off or brand them as enemies. Be as forgiving of them as you are of yourself. Cut them the same slack you would for yourself so that you can continue to work with them and make use of their talents.***
