# The opulent stoic

“The founder of the universe, who assigned to us the laws of life,
provided that we should live well, but not in luxury. Everything
needed for our well-being is right before us, whereas what luxury
requires is gathered by many miseries and anxieties. Let us use
this gift of nature and count it among the greatest things.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 119.15b

***Perspective: We can still live well without becoming slaves to luxury. And we don’t need to make decisions that force us to continue to work and work and work and drift further from study and contemplation in order to get more money to pay for the things we don’t need. There is no rule that says financial success must mean that you live beyond your means. Remember: humans can be happy with very little.***
