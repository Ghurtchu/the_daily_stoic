# Take charge and end your troubles

“You’ve endured countless troubles—all from not letting your ruling reason do the work it was made for—enough already!”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 9.26

***Perspective: Letting our reason rule the day might seem like more work, but it saves us quite a bit of trouble. As Ben Franklin’s proverb put it: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Your brain was designed to do this work. It was meant to separate what is important from what is senseless, to keep things in perspective, to only become troubled by that which is worth becoming troubled about. You only need to put it to use.***
