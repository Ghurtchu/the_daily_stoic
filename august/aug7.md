# Pragmatic and principled

“Wherever a person can live, there one can also live well; life is also in the demands of court, there too one can live well.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 5.16

***Perspective: Principles and pragmatism are not at odds. Whether you live in the snake pit of Washington, D.C., work among the materialism of Wall Street, or grew up in a closed-minded small town, you can live well. Plenty of others have.***
