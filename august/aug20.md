# Where it counts

“Inwardly, we ought to be different in every respect, but our outward dress should blend in with the crowd.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 5.2

***Perspective: It’s tempting to take philosophy to extremes, but who does that serve? In fact, rejection of the basics of society alienates other people, even threatens them. More important, outward transformation—in our clothes, in our cars, in our grooming—might feel important but is superficial compared with the inward change. That’s the change that only we know about.***
