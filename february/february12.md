# Protect your peace of mind

“Keep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadiness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your freedom. For what would you sell these things?”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.3.6b–8

***Perspective: Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource? Don’t be afraid to make a change—a big one.***
