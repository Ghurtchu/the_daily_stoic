# Circumstances have no care for our feelings

“You shouldn’t give circumstances the power to rouse anger, for they don’t care at all.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.38

***Perspective: That’s what Marcus was reminding himself of here: circumstances are incapable of considering or caring for your feelings, your anxiety, or your excitement. They don’t care about your reaction. They are not people. So stop acting like getting worked up is having an impact on a given situation. Situations don’t care at all.***
