# Prepare for the storm

“This is the true athlete—the person in rigorous training against
false impressions. Remain firm, you who suffer, don’t be
kidnapped by your impressions! The struggle is great, the task
divine—to gain mastery, freedom, happiness, and tranquility.” 

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.18.27–28

***Perspective: If we don’t have a plan, if we never learned how to put up the storm windows, we will be at the mercy of these external—and internal— elements. We’re still puny human beings compared with one-hundred-mile- per-hour winds, but we have the advantage of being able to prepare—being able to struggle against them in a new way.***
