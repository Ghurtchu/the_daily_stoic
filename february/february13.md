# Pleasure can become punishment

“Whenever you get an impression of some pleasure, as with any
impression, guard yourself from being carried away by it, let it
await your action, give yourself a pause. After that, bring to mind
both times, first when you have enjoyed the pleasure and later
when you will regret it and hate yourself. Then compare to those
the joy and satisfaction you’d feel for abstaining altogether.
However, if a seemingly appropriate time arises to act on it, don’t
be overcome by its comfort, pleasantness, and allure—but against
all of this, how much better the consciousness of conquering it.” 

—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 34

***Perspective: It’s important to connect the so-called temptation with its actual effects. Once you understand that indulging might actually be worse than resisting, the urge begins to lose its appeal. In this way, self-control becomes the real pleasure, and the temptation becomes the regret.***
