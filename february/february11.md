# Hero or nero?

“Our soul is sometimes a king, and sometimes a tyrant. A king, by attending to what is honorable, protects the good health of the body in its care, and gives it no base or sordid command. But an uncontrolled, desire-fueled, over-indulged soul is turned from a king into that most feared and detested thing—a tyrant.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 114.24

***Perspective: Tyrant or king? Hero or Nero? Which will you be?***
