# The source of your anxiety

“When I see an anxious person, I ask myself, what do they want?
For if a person wasn’t wanting something outside of their own
control, why would they be stricken by anxiety?”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.13.1

***Perspetcive: Today, when you find yourself getting anxious, ask yourself: Why are my insides twisted into knots? Am I in control here or is my anxiety? And most important: Is my anxiety doing me any good?***
