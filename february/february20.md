# The grand parade of desire

“Robbers, perverts, killers, and tyrants—gather for your inspection their so-called pleasures!”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.34

***Perspective: Ask yourself: Is that really worth it? Is it really that pleasurable? Consider that when you crave something or contemplate indulging in a “harmless” vice.***
