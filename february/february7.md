# Fear is a self fulfilling prophecy

“Many are harmed by fear itself, and many may have come to their fate while dreading fate.”

—SENECA, OEDIPUS, 992

***Perspective: The next time you are afraid of some supposedly disastrous outcome, remember that if you don’t control your impulses, if you lose your self- control, you may be the very source of the disaster you so fear. It has happened to smarter and more powerful and more successful people. It can happen to us too.***
