# You don't have to have an opinion

“We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to shape our judgments.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.52

***Perspective: In other words, it is possible to hold no opinion about a negative thing. You just need to cultivate that power instead of wielding it accidentally.***
