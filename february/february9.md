# You don't have to have an opition

“We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to shape our judgments.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.52

***Perspective: In other words, it is possible to hold no opinion about a negative thing. You just need to cultivate that power instead of wielding it accidentally.***

I found the flat on otodom.pl, 2 room apartment in the heart of Ursus. I would like to ask a few questions if you have time:
- What's the payment per month?
- Is it possible
- Is it possible to start living there from May 22?
