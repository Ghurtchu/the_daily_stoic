# Anger is bad fuel

“There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more arrogant, if foiled, none more insane—since it’s not driven back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes its adversary it turns its teeth on itself.”

—SENECA, ON ANGER, 3.1.5

***Perspective: Getting angry never solves anything, it makes things worse.***
