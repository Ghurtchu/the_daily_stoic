# Think before you act

“For to be wise is only one thing—to fix our attention on our intelligence, which guides all things everywhere.”

—HERACLITUS, QUOTED IN DIOGENES LAERTIUS, LIVES OF THE EMINENT 
PHILOSOPHERS, 9.1

***Perspective: Fix your attention on your intelligence. Let it do its thing.***
