# Wish not, want not

“Remember that it’s not only the desire for wealth and position that debases and subjugates us, but also the desire for peace, leisure, travel, and learning. It doesn’t matter what the external thing is, the value we place on it subjugates us to another . . . where our heart is set, there our impediment lies.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.4.1–2; 15

***Perspective: When it comes to your goals and the things you strive for, ask yourself: Am I in control of them or they in control of me?***
