# Today is the day

“You get what you deserve. Instead of being a good person today, you choose instead to become one tomorrow.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.22

“I don’t complain about the lack of time . . . what little I have will go far enough. Today—this day—will achieve what no tomorrow will fail to speak about. I will lay siege to the gods and shake up the world.”

—SENECA, MEDEA, 423–425

***Perspective: Today, not tomorrow, is the day that we can start to be good.***
