# Stop caring what people think

“I’m constantly amazed by how easily we love ourselves above all
others, yet we put more stock in the opinions of others than in our
own estimation of self. . . . How much credence we give to the
opinions our peers have of us and how little to our very own!” 

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 12.4

***Perspective: Don’t spend much time thinking about what other people think. Think about what you think. Think instead about the results, about the impact, about whether it is the right thing to do.***
