# Good and evil? Look at your choices

“Where is Good? In our reasoned choices. Where is Evil? In our
reasoned choices. Where is that which is neither Good nor Evil?
In the things outside of our own reasoned choice.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.16.1

***Perspective: Epictetus’s dictum helps us cut through all this with clarity and confidence. Is something good or bad? Is this right or wrong? Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices.***
