# Quality over quantity

“What’s the point of having countless books and libraries, whose
titles could hardly be read through in a lifetime. The learner is not
taught, but burdened by the sheer volume, and it’s better to plant
the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many.” 

—SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 9.4

***Perspective: What if, when it came to your reading and learning, you prioritized quality over quantity? What if you read the few great books deeply instead of briefly skimming all the new books? Your shelves might be emptier, but your brain and your life would be fuller.***
