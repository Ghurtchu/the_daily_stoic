# Work is therapy

“Work nourishes noble minds.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 31.5

***Perspective: It’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people. They leave so much of their potential unfulfilled because they have jobs where they don’t really do much or because they have too much time on their hands. Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things, going out, fighting, creating drama—indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real nourishment. The solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.***
