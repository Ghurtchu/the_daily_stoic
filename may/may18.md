# How you do anything is how you do everything

“Pay attention to what’s in front of you—the principle, the task, or what’s being portrayed.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.22

***Perspective: There is an old saying: “How you do anything is how you do everything.” It’s true. How you handle today is how you’ll handle every day. How you handle this minute is how you’ll handle every minute.***
