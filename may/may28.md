# The first two things before acting

“The first thing to do—don’t get worked up. For everything
happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time
you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors
Hadrian and Augustus are now. The next thing to do—consider
carefully the task at hand for what it is, while remembering that
your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing
what nature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and
fitting—with kindness, modesty, and sincerity.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.5

***Perspective: First, don’t get upset—because that will color your decision negatively and make it harder than it needs to be. Second, remember the purpose and principles you value most. Running potential actions through this filter will eliminate the bad choices and highlight the right ones. Don’t get upset. Do the right thing. That’s it.***
