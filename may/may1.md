“For philosophy doesn’t consist in outward display, but in taking heed to what is needed and being mindful of it.”

***Perspective: The monk dresses in his robes. A priest puts on his collar. A banker wears an expensive suit and carries a briefcase. A Stoic has no uniform and resembles no stereotype. They are not identifiable by look or by sight or by sound. The only way to recognize them? By their character.***
