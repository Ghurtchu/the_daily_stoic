# Carpe diem

“Let us therefore set out whole-heartedly, leaving aside our many
distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we
realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left
behind. As each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all,
and make it your own possession. We must seize what flees.” 

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 108.27b–28a

***Perspective: What will you manage to make of today before it slips from your fingers and becomes the past? When someone asks you what you did yesterday, do you really want the answer to be “nothing”?***
