# What's truly impressive

“How much better is it to be known for doing well by many than
for living extravagantly? How much more worthy than spending
on sticks and stones is it to spend on people?”

—MUSONIUS RUFUS, LECTURES, 19.91.26–28

***Perspective: The conspicuously wealthy earn and ultimately get what they want out of spending: their reputation. But what an empty one! Is it really that impressive to spend, spend, spend? Given the funds, who wouldn’t be able to do that? Marcus Aurelius courageously sold off some of the imperial furnishings to pay down war debts. More recently, José Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, stood out for giving 90 percent of his presidential salary to charity and driving a twenty-five-year-old car. Who can do stuff like that? Not everyone. So who’s the more impressive?***
