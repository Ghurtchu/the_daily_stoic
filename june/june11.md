# Just don't make things worse

“How much more harmful are the consequences of anger and grief than the circumstances that aroused them in us!”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 11.18.8

***Perspective: Today, give yourself the most simple and doable of tasks: just don’t make stuff worse. Whatever happens, don’t add angry or negative emotions to the equation. Don’t react for the sake of reacting. Leave it as it is. Stop digging. Then plan your way out.***
