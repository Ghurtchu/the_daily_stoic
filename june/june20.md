# Calm is contagious

“If then it’s not that the things you pursue or avoid are coming at
you, but rather that you in a sense are seeking them out, at least try
to keep your judgment of them steady, and they too will remain
calm and you won’t be seen chasing after or fleeing from them.” 

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 11.11

***Perspective: That’s who you want to be, whatever your line of work: the casual, relaxed person in every situation who tells everyone else to take a breath and not to worry. Because you’ve got this. Don’t be the agitator, the paranoid, the worrier, or the irrational. Be the calm, not the liability. It will catch on.***
