# No excuses

“It is possible to curb your arrogance, to overcome pleasure and
pain, to rise above your ambition, and to not be angry with stupid
and ungrateful people—yes, even to care for them.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.8

***Perspective: Of course it’s possible to curb our arrogance, control our anger, and be a caring person. How do you think others do it? Certainly their parents weren’t perfect; they didn’t come out of the womb incapable of ego or immune to temptation. They worked on it. They made it a priority. They solved it like they would solve any other problem: by dedicating themselves to finding a solution, making incremental progress until they did. They became who they are. Just like you can.***
