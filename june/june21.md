# Take a walk

“We should take wandering outdoor walks, so that the mind might be nourished and refreshed by the open air and deep breathing.”

—SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 17.8

***Perspective: Today, make sure you take a walk. And in the future, when you get stressed or overwhelmed, take a walk. When you have a tough problem to solve or a decision to make, take a walk. When you want to be creative, take a walk. When you need to get some air, take a walk. When you have a phone call to make, take a walk. When you need some exercise, take a long walk. When you have a meeting or a friend over, take a walk together. Nourish yourself and your mind and solve your problems along the way.***
