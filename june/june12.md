# A trained mind is better than any script

“In this way you must understand how laughable it is to say, ‘Tell
me what to do!’ What advice could I possibly give? No, a far
better request is, ‘Train my mind to adapt to any
circumstance.’ . . . In this way, if circumstances take you off
script . . . you won’t be desperate for a new prompting.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.2.20b–1; 24b–25a

***Perspective: Today, give yourself the most simple and doable of tasks: just don’t make stuff worse. Whatever happens, don’t add angry or negative emotions to the equation. Don’t react for the sake of reacting. Leave it as it is. Stop digging. Then plan your way out.***
