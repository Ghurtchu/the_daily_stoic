# Life is battlefield

“Don’t you know life is like a military campaign? One must serve
on watch, another in reconnaissance, another on the front line. . . .
So it is for us—each person’s life is a kind of battle, and a long
and varied one too. You must keep watch like a soldier and do
everything commanded. . . . You have been stationed in a key post,
not some lowly place, and not for a short time but for life.” 

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.24.31–36
