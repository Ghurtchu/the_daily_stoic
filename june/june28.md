# No self-flagellation needed

“Philosophy calls for simple living, but not for penance—it’s quite possible to be simple without being crude.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 5.5

***Perspective: Laying into yourself, unduly depriving yourself, punishing yourself— that’s self-flagellation, not self-improvement. No need to be too hard on yourself. Hold yourself to a higher standard but not an impossible one. And forgive yourself if and when you slip up.***
