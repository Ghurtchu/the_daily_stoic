# They can throw you in chains, but...

“You can bind up my leg, but not even Zeus has the power to break my freedom of choice.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.1.23

***Perspective: None of these men broke. No one could make them sacrifice their principles. That’s the thing—someone can throw you in chains, but they don’t have the power to change who you are. Even under the worst torture and cruelties that humans can inflict on one another, our power over our own mind and our power to make our own decisions can’t be broken—only relinquished.***
