# Our hidden power

“Consider who you are. Above all, a human being, carrying no
greater power than your own reasoned choice, which oversees all
other things, and is free from any other master.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.10.1

***Perspective: Your hidden power is your ability to use reason and make choices, however limited or small. Think about the areas of your life where you are under duress or weighed down by obligation. What are the choices available to you, day after day? You might be surprised at how many there actually are. Are you taking advantage? Are you finding the positives?***
