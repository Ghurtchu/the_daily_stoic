# The vulnerability of dependence

“Show me someone who isn’t a slave! One is a slave to lust,
another to greed, another to power, and all are slaves to fear. I
could name a former Consul who is a slave to a little old woman, a
millionaire who is the slave of the cleaning woman. . . . No
servitude is more abject than the self-imposed.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 47.17

***Perspective: This is why we must strengthen ourselves by testing these dependencies before they become too great. Can you try going without this or that for a day? Can you put yourself on a diet for a month? Can you resist the urge to pick up the phone to make that call? Have you ever taken a cold shower? It’s not so bad after the first couple of times. Have you ever driven a friend’s car while the nicer one you own was in the shop? Was it really that bad? Make yourself invulnerable to your dependency on comfort and convenience, or one day your vulnerability might bring you to your knees.***
