# Nothing to fear but fear itself

“But there is no reason to live and no limit to our miseries if we let our fears predominate.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 13.12b

***Perspective: The Stoics knew that fear was to be feared because of the miseries it creates. The things we fear pale in comparison to the damage we do to ourselves and others when we unthinkingly scramble to avoid them. An economic depression is bad; a panic is worse. A tough situation isn’t helped by terror—it only makes things harder. And that’s why we must resist it and reject it if we wish to turn this situation around.***
