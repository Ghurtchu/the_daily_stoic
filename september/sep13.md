# Protecting our inner fortress from fear

“No, it is events that give rise to fear—when another has power
over them or can prevent them, that person becomes able to
inspire fear. How is the fortress destroyed? Not by iron or fire, but
by judgments . . . here is where we must begin, and it is from this
front that we must seize the fortress and throw out the tyrants.” 

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.1.85–86; 87a

***Perspective: But history teaches us that impenetrable fortresses can still be breached, if betrayed from the inside. The citizens inside the walls—if they fall prey to fear or greed or avarice—can open the gates and let the enemy in. This is what many of us do when we lose our nerve and give in to fear. You’ve been granted a strong fortress. Don’t betray it.***
