# How can you know whether you've never been tested?

“I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through
misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent—
no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.” 

—SENECA, ON PROVIDENCE, 4.3

***Perspective: There’s another benefit of so-called misfortune. Having experienced and survived it, we walk away with a better understanding of our own capacity and inner strength. Passing a trial by fire is empowering because you know that in the future you can survive similar adversity. “What does not kill me makes me stronger,” Nietzsche said. So today if things look like they might take a bad turn or your luck might change, why worry? This might be one of those formative experiences you will be grateful for later.***
