# Judgments cause disturbance

“It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their judgments about them.”

—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 5

***Perspective: An event is inanimate. It’s objective. It simply is what it is. That’s what our observing eye sees. This will ruin me. How could this have happened? Ugh! It’s so-and-so’s fault. That’s our perceiving eye at work. Bringing disturbance with it and then blaming it on the event.***
