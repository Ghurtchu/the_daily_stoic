# Turn it inside out

“Turn it inside out and see what it is like—what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself. How short-lived the praiser and praised, the one who remembers and the remembered. Remembered in some corner of these parts, and even there not in the same way by all, or even by one. And the whole earth is but a mere speck.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.21

***Perspective: Dig into your fear of death or obscurity, and what will you find? Turn some fancy ceremony inside out and you’ll find—what?***
