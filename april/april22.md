# The marks of the rational person

“These are the characteristics of the rational soul: self-awareness,
self-examination, and self-determination. It reaps its own
harvest. . . . It succeeds in its own purpose . . .”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 11.1–2

***Perspective: To be rational today, we have to do just three things: First, we must look inward. Next, we must examine ourselves critically. Finally, we must make our own decisions—uninhibited by biases or popular notions.***
