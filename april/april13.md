# Less is more

“Don’t act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or to be a
contrarian. Don’t overdress your thought in fine language. Don’t
be a person of too many words and too many deeds. . . . Be
cheerful, not wanting outside help or the relief others might bring.
A person needs to stand on their own, not be propped up.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 3.5

***Perspective: Imagine the emperor of Rome, with his captive audience and unlimited power, telling himself not to be a person of “too many words and too many deeds.” Let that be a reminder the next time you feel self-indulgent or a little full of yourself, the next time you feel like impressing people.***
