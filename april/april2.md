# Be wary of what you let in

“Drama, combat, terror, numbness, and subservience—every day
these things wipe out your sacred principles, whenever your mind
entertains them uncritically or lets them slip in.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 10.9

***Perspective: We’ll inevitably be exposed to these influences at some point, no matter how much we try to avoid them. But when we are, there is nothing that says we have to allow those influences to penetrate our minds. We have the ability to put our guard up and decide what we actually allow in. Uninvited guests might arrive at your home, but you don’t have to ask them to stay for dinner. You don’t have to let them into your mind.***
