# Wants make you a servant

“Tantalus: The highest power is—
Thyestes: No power, if you desire nothing.”

—SENECA, THYESTES, 440

***Perspective: The late fashion photographer Bill Cunningham occasionally declined to invoice magazines for his work. When a young upstart asked him why that was, Cunningham’s response was epic: “If you don’t take money, they can’t tell you what to do, kid.” Remember: taking the money, wanting the money—proverbially or literally—makes you a servant to the people who have it. Indifference to it, as Seneca put it, turns the highest power into no power, at least as far as your life is concerned.***
