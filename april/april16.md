# Observe cause and effect

“Pay close attention in conversation to what is being said, and to
what follows from any action. In the action, immediately look for
the target, in words, listen closely to what’s being signaled.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.4

***Perspective: Only when this is done can negative behavior patterns be broken; only then can real life improvements be made.***
