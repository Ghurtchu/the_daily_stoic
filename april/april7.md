# Expect to change your opinions

“There are two things that must be rooted out in human beings—
arrogant opinion and mistrust. Arrogant opinion expects that there
is nothing further needed, and mistrust assumes that under the
torrent of circumstance there can be no happiness.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.14.8

***Perspective: Remember, if there is one core teaching at the heart of this philosophy, it’s that we’re not as smart and as wise as we’d like to think we are. If we ever do want to become wise, it comes from the questioning and from humility—not, as many would like to think, from certainty, mistrust, and arrogance.***
