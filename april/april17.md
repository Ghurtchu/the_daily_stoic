# No harm no foul

“Do away with the opinion I am harmed, and the harm is cast away too. Do away with being harmed, and harm disappears.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 4.7

***Perspective: If being upset or hurt is something you’d like to experience less often, then make sure your interpretations of others’ words make that possible. Choose the right inference from someone’s actions or from external events, and it’s a lot more likely that you’ll have the right response.***
