# Cutting back on the costly

“So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously
exert ourselves, we owe this consideration—either there is nothing
useful in them, or most aren’t useful. Some of them are
superfluous, while others aren’t worth that much. But we don’t
discern this and see them as free, when they cost us dearly.” 

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 42.6

***Perspective: Remember: even what we get for free has a cost, if only in what we pay to store it—in our garages and in our minds. As you walk past your possessions today, ask yourself: Do I need this? Is it superfluous? What’s this actually worth? What is it costing me? You might be surprised by the answers and how much we’ve been paying without even knowing it.***
