# Don't tell yourself stories

In public avoid talking often and excessively about your accomplishments and dangers, for however much you enjoy recounting your dangers, it’s not so pleasant for others to hear about your affairs.”

—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 33.14

***Perspective: Try your best not to create this fantasy bubble—live in what’s real. Listen and connect with people, don’t perform for them.***
