# Timeless wisdom

“For there are two rules to keep at the ready—that there is nothing
good or bad outside my own reasoned choice, and that we
shouldn’t try to lead events but to follow them.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.10.18

***Perspective: Remember, each individual has a choice. You are always the one in control. The cause of irritation—or our notion that something is bad—that comes from us, from our labels or our expectations. Just as easily, we can change those labels; we can change our entitlement and decide to accept and love what’s happening around us. And this wisdom has been repeated and independently discovered in every century and every country since time began.***
