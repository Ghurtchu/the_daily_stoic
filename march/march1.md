# Where philosophy begins

“An important place to begin in philosophy is this: a clear perception of one’s own ruling principle.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.26.15

***Perspective: Perhaps we could say that we begin our journey into philosophy when we become aware of the ability to analyze our own minds. Can you start with that step today? When you do, you’ll find that from it we really come alive, that we live lives—to paraphrase Socrates—that are actually worth living.***
