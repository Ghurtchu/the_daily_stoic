# Accurate self-assessment

“Above all, it is necessary for a person to have a true self-estimate, for we commonly think we can do more than we really can.”

—SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 5.2

***Perspective: We underestimate our capabilities just as much and just as dangerously as we overestimate other abilities. Cultivate the ability to judge yourself accurately and honestly. Look inward to discern what you’re capable of and what it will take to unlock that potential.***
