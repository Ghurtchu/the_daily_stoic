# Don't trust the senses

“Heraclitus called self-deception an awful disease and eyesight a lying sense.”

—DIOGENES LAERTIUS, LIVES OF THE EMINENT PHILOSOPHERS, 9.7

***Perspective: Because our senses are often wrong, our emotions overly alarmed, our projections overly optimistic, we’re better off not rushing into conclusions about anything. We can take a beat with everything we do and become aware of everything that’s going on so we can make the right decision.***
