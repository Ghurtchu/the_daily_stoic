# One day it will all make sense

“Whenever you find yourself blaming providence, turn it around in your mind and you will see that what has happened is in keeping with reason.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.17.1

***Perspective: This sense of being wronged is a simple awareness problem. We need to remember that all things are guided by reason—but that it is a vast and universal reason that we cannot always see. That the surprise hurricane was the result of a butterfly flapping its wings a hemisphere away or that misfortune we have experienced is simply the prelude to a pleasant and enviable future.***
