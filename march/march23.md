# The straightjacketed soul

“The diseases of the rational soul are long-standing and hardened
vices, such as greed and ambition—they have put the soul in a
straitjacket and have begun to be permanent evils inside it. To put
it briefly, this sickness is an unrelenting distortion of judgment, so
things that are only mildly desirable are vigorously sought after.” 

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 75.11

***Perspective: It doesn’t do you much good to criticize those folks after the fact. It’s better to look at how greed and vices might be having a similar effect in your own life. What lapses in judgment might your vices be causing you? What “sicknesses” might you have?***
