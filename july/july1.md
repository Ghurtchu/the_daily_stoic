# Do your job

“Whatever anyone does or says, for my part I’m bound to the good. In the same way an emerald or gold or purple might always proclaim: ‘whatever anyone does or says, I must be what I am and show my true colors.’”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.15

***Perspective: Do your job today. Whatever happens, whatever other people’s jobs happen to be, do yours. Be good.***
