# Turn "have to" into "get to"

“The task of a philosopher: we should bring our will into harmony
with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against our will
and nothing that we wish for fails to happen.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.14.7

***Perspective: Kidding aside, it might not seem like it makes a big difference to see life as something you have to do versus get to do, but there is. A huge, magnificent difference.***
