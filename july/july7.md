# Our duty to learn

“This is what you should teach me, how to be like Odysseus—how to love my country, wife and father, and how, even after suffering shipwreck, I might keep sailing on course to those honorable ends.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 88.7b

***Perspective: We’re not trying to ace tests or impress teachers. We are reading and studying to live, to be good human beings—always and forever.***
