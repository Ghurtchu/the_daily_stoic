# Receive honors and slights exactly the same way

“Receive without pride, let go without attachment.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.33

***Perspective: That’s what Marcus is saying. Do not take the slights of the day personally—or the exciting rewards and recognitions either, especially when duty has assigned you an important cause. Trivial details like the rise and fall of your position say nothing about you as a person. Only your behavior—as Cato’s did—will.***
