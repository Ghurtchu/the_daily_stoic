# Where is anything better?

“Indeed, if you find anything in human life better than justice, truth, self-control, courage—in short, anything better than the sufficiency of your own mind, which keeps you acting according to the demands of true reason and accepting what fate gives you outside of your own power of choice—I tell you, if you can see anything better than this, turn to it heart and soul and take full advantage of this greater good you’ve found.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 3.6.1

***Perspective: It’s not enough to just not do evil. You must also be a force for good in the world, as best you can.***
