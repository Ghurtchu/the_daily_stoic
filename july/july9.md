# The philosopher king

“For I believe a good king is from the outset and by necessity a philosopher, and the philosopher is from the outset a kingly person.”

—MUSONIUS RUFUS, LECTURES, 8.33.32–34

***Perspective: Plato knew this when he imagined a utopia ruled by a philosopher king. “Either philosophers should become kings,” he said in The Republic, “or those now called kings should truly and sufficiently undertake philosophy.” Marcus Aurelius was quite literally that philosopher king. What does that have to do with you? There are fewer kings these days, but we’re all leaders in one way or another—of families, of companies, of a team, of an audience, of a group of friends, of ourselves. It’s the study of philosophy that cultivates our reason and ethics so that we can do our job well. We can’t just wing it—too many people are counting on us to do it right.***
