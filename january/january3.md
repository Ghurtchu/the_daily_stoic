# Be ruthless to the things that don't matter

“How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of what you were losing, 
how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how little of your own was left to you. 
You will realize you are dying before your time!”

—SENECA, ON THE BREVITY OF LIFE, 3.3b

***Perspective: Say fucking no to the things that don't matter.***
