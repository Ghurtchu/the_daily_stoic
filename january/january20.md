# Reignite your thoughts

“Your principles can’t be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that feed them, 
for it’s continually in your power to reignite new ones. . . . 
It’s possible to start living again! See things anew as you once did—that is how to restart life!”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.2

***Perspective: What happened yesterday—what happened five minutes ago—is the past. We can reignite and restart whenever we like.***
