# Push for deep understanding

“From Rusticus . . . I learned to read carefully and not be satisfied
with a rough understanding of the whole, and not to agree too
quickly with those who have a lot to say about something.” —MARCUS 

-AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 1.7.3

***Perspective: That’s the kind of deep reading and study we need to cultivate as well, which is why we’re reading just one page a day instead of a chapter at a time. So we can take the time to read attentively and deeply.***
