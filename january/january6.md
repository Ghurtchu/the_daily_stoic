# Where, who, what and why

“A person who doesn’t know what the universe is, doesn’t know
where they are. A person who doesn’t know their purpose in life
doesn’t know who they are or what the universe is. A person who
doesn’t know any one of these things doesn’t know why they are
here. So what to make of people who seek or avoid the praise of
those who have no knowledge of where or who they are?”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.52

***Perspetcive: Unleash your true self, look deep in your heart, understand your character, be the main hero of your movie.***
