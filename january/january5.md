# Clarify your intentions


“Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end in view. 
It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad.”

—SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 12.5

***Perspective: Begin with the end in mind, plan things, avoid directionlessness***
