# Education is freedom


“What is the fruit of these teachings? 
Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educated — 
tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom. 
We should not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, 
but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.1.21–23a

***Perspective: Educate yourself to become free, fear less and learn how to live properly. All knowledge but particularly self-knowledge is freedom.***
