# See the world like a poet and an artist


“Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 4.48.2


***Perspective: Appreciate the rules of nature, be in harmony with it.***
