# The one path to serenity 

“Keep this thought at the ready at daybreak, and through the day
and night—there is only one path to happiness, and that is in
giving up all outside of your sphere of choice, regarding nothing
else as your possession, surrendering all else to God and Fortune.” 

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.4.39

***Perspective: As you lie in bed, remember that sleep is a form of surrender and trust and how easily it comes. And prepare to start the whole cycle over again tomorrow.***
