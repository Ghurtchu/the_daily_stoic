# Reboot the real work

“I am your teacher and you are learning in my school. My aim is to
bring you to completion, unhindered, free from compulsive
behavior, unrestrained, without shame, free, flourishing, and
happy, looking to God in things great and small—your aim is to
learn and diligently practice all these things. Why then don’t you
complete the work, if you have the right aim and I have both the
right aim and right preparation? What is missing? . . . The work is
quite feasible, and is the only thing in our power. . . . Let go of the
past. We must only begin. Believe me and you will see.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.19.29–34

***Perspective: Just begin the work. The rest follows.***
