# Cut the strings that pull your mind

“Understand at last that you have something in you more powerful and divine than what causes the bodily passions and pulls you like a mere puppet.
What thoughts now occupy my mind? Is it not fear, suspicion, desire, or something like that?”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 12.19

***Perspective: Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values - cut off unimportant stuff, e.g: social media, TV, lust, temptation, sugar, alcohol, bitches, gossiping, gambling and the list goes on.***
