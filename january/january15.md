# Peace is in staying the course

“Tranquility can’t be grasped except by those who have reached an unwavering and firm power of judgment—the rest constantly fall and rise in their decisions, wavering in a state of alternately rejecting and accepting things. What is the cause of this back and forth? It’s because nothing is clear and they rely on the most uncertain guide—common opinion.”

—SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 95.57b–58a

***Perspective: Ignore the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn toward the rocks, belive in yourself, avoid directionless peoples' opinions.***
