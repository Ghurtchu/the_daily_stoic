# The power of mantra

“Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out any evil, desire or any kind of disturbance—instead, seeing the true nature of things, I will give them only their due. Always remember this power that nature gave you.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.29

***Perspective: have a mantra and use it to find the clarity you crave.***
