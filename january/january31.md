# Philosophy as medicine of soul

“Don’t return to philosophy as a task-master, but as patients seek out relief in a treatment of sore eyes, or a dressing for a burn, or from an ointment. Regarding it this way, you’ll obey reason without putting it on display and rest easy in its care.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 5.9
