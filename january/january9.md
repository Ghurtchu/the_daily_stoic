# What we control and what we don't

“Some things are in our control, while others are not. 
We control our opinion, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything of our own doing. 
We don’t control our body, property, reputation, position, and, in a word, everything not of our own doing. 
Even more, the things in our control are by nature free, unhindered, and unobstructed, 
while those not in our control are weak, slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own.”

—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 1.1–2
