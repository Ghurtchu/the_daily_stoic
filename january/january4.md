# The big three

“All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment;
action for the common good in the present moment;
and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way.”

—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 9.6

***Perspective: Control your perceptions. Direct your actions properly. Willingly accept what's outside your control.***
