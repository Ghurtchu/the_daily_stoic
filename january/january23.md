“Let’s pass over to the really rich—how often the occasions they look just like the poor! When they travel abroad they must restrict their baggage, and when haste is necessary, they dismiss their entourage. And those who are in the army, how few of their possessions they get to keep . . .”

—SENECA, ON CONSOLATION TO HELVIA, 12. 1.b–2

***Perspective: Without an internal change money will not solve our problems.***
