# Circle of control

“We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that moral will. 
What’s not under our control are the body and any of its parts, 
our possessions, parents, siblings, children, or country— anything with which we might associate.”

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.22.10

***Perspective: The only thing you can really control is your mind, manage your choices, your will, your mind.***
